# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Terminal User Interface (TUI) application in Rust that enables users to communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs) directly from their terminal. The application provides enhanced functionality through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by allowing users to grant access to specific directories and files (such as configuration files and Obsidian vaults) that serve as a knowledge base for more contextual and personalized responses. The system focuses on helping users with system configuration tasks and personal planning by leveraging their existing local files and directories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a terminal user, I want to interact with LLMs through a clean TUI interface, so that I can get AI assistance without leaving my terminal environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user launches the application THEN the system SHALL display a terminal-based user interface with clear input and output areas
2. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to the configured LLM and display the response
3. WHEN the user navigates the interface THEN the system SHALL provide command shortcuts (e.g., /help, /config, /clear) for common actions
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display help information about available commands
5. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL stream the LLM response in real-time as it's generated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure which LLM provider and model to use, so that I can choose the best AI assistant for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first runs the application THEN the system SHALL prompt for LLM configuration if none exists
2. WHEN the user configures an LLM provider THEN the system SHALL support popular providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models
3. WHEN the user saves LLM configuration THEN the system SHALL store the settings securely and persistently
4. WHEN the user wants to change LLM settings THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration interface within the TUI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to grant the AI access to specific directories and files on my system, so that it can provide contextual assistance based on my local data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to add a data source THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific directories or files
2. WHEN the user grants access to a directory THEN the system SHALL recursively index supported file types within that directory
3. WHEN the user grants access to files THEN the system SHALL validate file permissions and accessibility
4. WHEN the user manages data sources THEN the system SHALL provide options to add, remove, and list configured sources
5. WHEN accessing user files THEN the system SHALL respect file permissions and handle access errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to use my local files as context for responses, so that I get personalized and relevant assistance for system configuration and planning tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user asks a question THEN the system SHALL search relevant local files for contextual information
2. WHEN relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL include this information in the LLM prompt
3. WHEN the AI references local files THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which files were used as sources
4. WHEN no relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL proceed with the query using only the base LLM knowledge
5. WHEN processing file content THEN the system SHALL handle various file formats including text, markdown, JSON, configuration files, code files, and log files
6. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL only include files small enough to be provided as complete context to the LLM
7. WHEN indexing directories THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns for including/excluding specific file types or patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to maintain conversation history within sessions, so that I can have coherent multi-turn conversations with context preservation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context throughout the session
2. WHEN the user scrolls through conversation history THEN the system SHALL display previous messages and responses clearly
3. WHEN the user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear history or continue from previous session
4. WHEN the conversation becomes long THEN the system SHALL handle context window limits gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and handle errors gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when network or file system issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
2. WHEN file access fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation without crashing
3. WHEN the LLM API returns an error THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and remain responsive

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure a global system prompt and customize keybindings, so that the AI behavior aligns with my preferences and I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures a global system prompt THEN the system SHALL include this prompt in all LLM interactions
2. WHEN the user updates the system prompt THEN the system SHALL apply changes to subsequent conversations
3. WHEN the user configures keybindings THEN the system SHALL allow customization of keyboard shortcuts
4. WHEN the user sets preferences THEN the system SHALL save and persist these settings
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load and apply user preferences automatically

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send provisional messages that don't get logged in conversation history, so that I can experiment with queries without cluttering my conversation context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a provisional message THEN the system SHALL process it normally but not store it in conversation history
2. WHEN the user toggles provisional mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current mode in the interface
3. WHEN provisional mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to distinguish it from normal mode
4. WHEN the user sends a provisional message THEN the system SHALL not include it in context for subsequent messages
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use a configurable default for provisional mode (on/off)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run multiple instances of the application simultaneously, so that I can manage different conversations or contexts in separate terminal windows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user launches multiple instances THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access to configuration and data files safely
2. WHEN multiple instances are running THEN the system SHALL maintain separate conversation histories for each instance
3. WHEN instances access shared resources THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption through appropriate file locking or coordination

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want conversations to be stored transparently as text files, so that I can access and manage my conversation history outside the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has a conversation THEN the system SHALL automatically save it as a .txt or .md file
2. WHEN conversations are saved THEN the system SHALL use a clear, readable format
3. WHEN the user wants to access old conversations THEN the system SHALL store them in an organized directory structure
4. WHEN the system saves conversations THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and metadata

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want the RAG system to use a structured LLM-guided approach for file selection, so that I get relevant context through a clear multi-step process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user asks a question with RAG enabled THEN the system SHALL send the user query and available file names/paths to the LLM
2. WHEN the LLM receives the query and file list THEN the system SHALL allow the LLM to respond with keywords to search for
3. WHEN the LLM provides keywords THEN the system SHALL search indexed files and send search results back to the LLM
4. WHEN the LLM receives search results THEN the system SHALL allow the LLM to request specific files for detailed context
5. WHEN the LLM requests specific files THEN the system SHALL provide the complete content of those files to the LLM
6. WHEN the LLM has all requested context THEN the system SHALL allow the LLM to generate the final response

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle RAG functionality on and off, so that I can choose when to use local file context versus pure LLM responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures RAG settings THEN the system SHALL provide a default setting for RAG enabled/disabled
2. WHEN the user wants to toggle RAG THEN the system SHALL provide a command or shortcut to enable/disable RAG for the current session
3. WHEN RAG is disabled THEN the system SHALL send queries directly to the LLM without file context
4. WHEN RAG is enabled THEN the system SHALL follow the structured multi-step RAG process
5. WHEN the RAG state changes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current RAG status in the interface
